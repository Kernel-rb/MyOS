# STEP 1 : 
# Intro :
## Bare Machine:
### Definiton :
    -   is a  computer executing instruction directly on logic hardware without an operating system.
## Freestanding Environment:
    -   To create an os, we need code that does not depend on ant os features.
    -   we call it **freestanding** or **bare-metal**.
## Panic occurs :
    - when the kernel  encounters an unrecoverable error.
    - usually, the kernel prints an error message and halts the system.
## Kernel:
    -   is the core of the operating system.
    -   it is the first program that runs when the computer starts.
    -   it is responsible for managing the system's resources.


### diverging funcitons : 
     -  A function that never returns. 
     -  it's a fucntion who will be used to handle the panic.

### Copy Semantic  : 
     -  The copy semantic is used when we want to copy the value of a variable into another variable.
     - example: 
        ```rust
        let x = 5;
        let y = x;
        println:({}, {} , x, y);
        ```
## In our OS , we don't wanne use the **Structured Exception Handling** (SEH) and **Termination Handling** (TH) bcz Rust  we have an amternative to them.

### Structured Exception Handling : 
    -   is a mechanism to handle exceptions at runtime
    -   there i 2 types of exception on win :
        a - Hardware exception : 
            -   are generated by the processor when an error occurs.
        b - Software exception :
            -   are generated by the application or the operating system. 

### Termination Handling :
    -   is a mechanism to handle the termination of a program.
    -   it is used to release resources and clean up the program's state.

## Compile Time : 
    -   is the period when the program is compiled.

## Run Time 
    -   is the period when the program is running.
    -   it starts when the program is executed and ends when the program is terminated.

## crt0 : 
    -  in Rust , the entry point of the program is the main function.
## name mangling : 
    -   is a technique used by the compiler to encode the names of the functions and variables in the object file.
    -   it is used to avoid name conflicts and to support function overloading.

## Linker Erros : 
    -  Linker is a program that combines the genrated code into an executable program.
    - to Handle the **error** :
        -  **<arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<env>**,

        -- arch = x86_64, i386, arm, thumb, mips, etc.

        -- sub = for ex. on ARM: v5, v6m, v7a, v7m, etc.

        -- vendor = pc, apple, nvidia, ibm, etc.

        -- sys = none, linux, win32, darwin, cuda, etc.

        -- env = eabi, gnu, android, macho, elf, etc.

## ABI : 
    - application binary interface is an interface between two binary program modules 

# STEP 2 : 
## Boot Process :
    - the first thing:  The ROM (Read-Only Memory) contains the firmware.
    - This code performes a power-on self-test (POST) to check the hardware.
    - In the x86 architecture : 
        a - BIOS (old) => Basic Input/Output System
        b - UEFI (new) => Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
## CPU Modes : 
    - 1 - Real Mode : 
        - 16-bit mode
        - no memory protection
        - no multitasking
    - 2 - Protected Mode : 
        - 32-bit mode
        - memory protection
        - multitasking
    - 3 - Long Mode : 
        - 64-bit mode
        - memory protection
        - multitasking
