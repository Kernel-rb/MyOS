# Intro :
## Bare Machine:
### Definiton :
    -   is a  computer executing instruction directly on logic hardware without an operating system.
## Freestanding Environment:
    -   To create an os, we need code that does not depend on ant os features.
    -   we call it **freestanding** or **bare-metal**.
## Panic occurs :
    - when the kernel  encounters an unrecoverable error.
    - usually, the kernel prints an error message and halts the system.
## Kernel:
    -   is the core of the operating system.
    -   it is the first program that runs when the computer starts.
    -   it is responsible for managing the system's resources.


### diverging funcitons : 
     -  A function that never returns. 
     -  it's a fucntion who will be used to handle the panic.

### Copy Semantic  : 
     -  The copy semantic is used when we want to copy the value of a variable into another variable.
     - example: 
        ```rust
        let x = 5;
        let y = x;
        println:({}, {} , x, y);
        ```
## In our OS , we don't wanne use the **Structured Exception Handling** (SEH) and **Termination Handling** (TH) bcz Rust  we have an amternative to them.

### Structured Exception Handling : 
    -   is a mechanism to handle exceptions at runtime
    -   there i 2 types of exception on win :
        a - Hardware exception : 
            -   are generated by the processor when an error occurs.
        b - Software exception :
            -   are generated by the application or the operating system. 

### Termination Handling :
    -   is a mechanism to handle the termination of a program.
    -   it is used to release resources and clean up the program's state.

## Compile Time : 
    -   is the period when the program is compiled.

## Run Time 
    -   is the period when the program is running.
    -   it starts when the program is executed and ends when the program is terminated.

## crt0 : 
    -  in Rust , the entry point of the program is the main function.
## name mangling : 
    -   is a technique used by the compiler to encode the names of the functions and variables in the object file.
    -   it is used to avoid name conflicts and to support function overloading.
